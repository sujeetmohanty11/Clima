## *The Weather App*

**Operating System Requirment**   : Mac OS 10.15 or Later

**Xcode Version**                 : 11.0 or Later

In this Project, I have made a beautiful, dark-mode enabled weather app.
Here we'll be able to check the weather for the current location based on the GPS data from the iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually.

This App is based on JSON Parsing with the native Encodable and Decodable protocols and Core Location to get the current location from the phone GPS.

The Data is Parsed from the website : https://openweathermap.org after getting the GPS data or Searched City Name from iPhone.
